  Zero Trust Network Access
---
Recent explosion in work-from-home culture, where the enterprise laptops are deployed in most insecure networks, dramatically increases enterprise risk exposure. Enterprise IT lacks visibility or control over such remote networks. Therefore we must protect these laptops from lateral threat exposure. Airgap ensure that the enterprise laptops are Zero Trust Isolated in all networks including home, public hotspot, or corporate networks reducing enterprise threat surface. When coupled with secure application access, enterprises can take advantage of a comprehensive Zero Trust protection.

- Zero Trust Isolation of remote laptops
- Non isolated laptops are denied access to business assets
- EDR integration to ensure only protected and uncompromised laptops have access to business assets
- Unified policy allows seamless migration between corporate and remote networks
