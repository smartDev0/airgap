Responding to ransomware incidence is a big challenge for average SecOps organization. Often, the SecOps teams try to isolate infected devices - only to realize that there is no easy way to identify all of the infected machines. Alternatively, the SecOps organization often resort to isolating the entire network segment or impacting business continuity. Unfortunately, there are no easy buttons when comes to ransomware incidence response - not until now. Designed on top of Zero Trust Isolation™ Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform, Airgap’s Ransomware Kill Switch™ mitigates the propagation of ransomware on a network. As soon as malware is detected, “1-Click” instantly stops all lateral traffic, isolating and containing any ransomware to infected devices.

Airgap offers complete control of the Ransomware Kill Switch via APIs so that the IT organization can leverage existing tools such as SIEM, SOAR, and EDRs for rapid ransomware response.
