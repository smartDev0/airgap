The number of ransomware attacks skyrocketed in 2020 - an increase of about 715% in 2020, according to the Mid-Year Threat Landscape Report 2020. Thereâ€™s no reason to believe that this onslaught is going to stop anytime soon. Cybercriminals are coming up with more sophisticated and creative ways to penetrate corporate and home networks.
