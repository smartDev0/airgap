We are looking for an experienced Principal Software Engineer with hands-on experience on the Linux User-space/Kernel and with Debian based distributions. In-depth knowledge of different layers of the software networking stack such as Layer 2 switching (both physical and virtual such as Linux bridging and Open VSwitch), Layer 3 forwarding, and Routing (OSPF, BGP), and overlay technologies such as VxLAN, L2/GRE and IPSec encryption. The ability to work with the Linux kernel TCP/IP stack and leverage key open-source technologies is a must.  
 
The job involves designing innovative and high performing software data path solutions for the next generation of networks. The ideal candidate also has in-depth experience in Datacenter Software-Defined Networking (SDN) technologies such as VxLAN, NVGRE, and other solutions such as VMware NSX. Practical experience with unicast routing protocols such as OSPF and BGP and multicast protocols is desirable. 
 
# Responsibilities 
- Design innovative data path solutions by leveraging a combination of off-the-shelf packet processing technologies and custom code developed in-house. 
- Debug packet drops and other performance issues to ensure that we have a scalable high performing data path. 
 
# Requirements 
- 10+ years of software development experience in data path including L2 switching, routing protocols, SDN, and secure encryption. 
- Deep understanding of current data center and enterprise networking technologies. 
- Experience working with RESTful APIs and writing Python agents for policy download. 
- Desirable to have some programming experience with Golang. 
- Good communication skills and a flexible mindset to adapt products to fit customer needs. 
 
# The Team 
Our engineering team is at the core of our products – connected directly to our company’s mission of providing the best defense against Ransomware. We are constantly innovating – challenging the way we, and the industry, think about ransomware protection. Our engineers don’t shy away from building products to solve problems no one has pursued before. 
 
We define the industry, instead of waiting for directions. We need individuals who feel comfortable in ambiguity and are excited by the prospect of a challenge. 
 
# Qualifications 
- Bachelor’s or master’s degree in Computer Science or similar field 
- 10+ years of software development experience.
