IoTs (Internet of things) have the potential to impact every aspect of today’s business. It is estimated that by 2025, 17 Billion IoTs will make their way to enterprise networks. However, these devices aren’t often designed with security in mind. Unique in their footprint and typically designed in a hurry across the border, these devices represent the biggest risk for enterprises, especially in healthcare, manufacturing, retail, and government sectors. Instead of deploying all your IoTs in a shared VLAN compounding the risk, we recommend Agentless Zero Trust Isolation for each of these devices and eliminate unauthorized communication to/from such devices for definitive protection against cyber threats.

* Agentless Zero Trust Isolation solution works for all IoTs across all business sectors
* Zero Trust Isolation for all devices limits lateral propagation of threats. This contains threat exposure to single device
* Protection against default password breaches by SSO enabling the IoT configuration – no change to IoTs necessary
* SSO authentication for accessing IoT configuration to ensure only authorized personnel make the necessary configuration changes
