We all know that once the Ransomware gets inside the enterprise perimeter, it only takes a few seconds to wreak havoc and steal mass amount of data as well as possibly encrypt all assets. This is possible because the traditional security systems allow excessive access between business assets. We address the Ransomware challenge by implementing comprehensive Zero Trust Isolation for all devices to limit unauthorized communication. Additionally, we ensure that the remote laptops that are accessing business assets from home or public hotspots are also Zero Trust Isolated. Here is how we protect enterprises:

* Zero Trust Isolation for all devices limit lateral propagation of ransomware. This contains threat exposure to single device
* Unified SSO authentication for business and SaaS applications. This prevents the spread from compromised device to business applications
* SSO authentication for accessing IoT configuration. This ensures that vulnerable enterprise IoTs arenâ€™t breached
* Integration with EDR to ensure compromised devices are declined access business assets
