Traditional firewall and security appliances have largely ignored LAN security. The result is that, once inside your network, the threat has freedom to move laterally in a shared LAN environment. This has been the cause of majority of cyber-breaches. Moreover, with work-from-home culture, the enterprise assets are deployed in most insecure networks increasing the risk exposure. We address this challenge by implementing comprehensive Zero Trust for all devices to limit unauthorized communication. Additionally, we ensure that the remote laptops that are accessing business assets from home or public hotspots are also Zero Trust Isolated. Here is how we protect enterprises:

* Zero Trust Isolation for all devices limits lateral propagation of threat. This contains threat exposure to single device
* Unified SSO authentication for business and SaaS applications. This prevents the spread from compromised device to business applications
* SSO authentication for accessing IoT configuration. This ensures that vulnerable enterprise IoTs arenâ€™t breached
* Integration with EDR to ensure compromised devices are declined access to business assets
