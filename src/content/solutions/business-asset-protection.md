Majority of the threats start with compromising one endpoint in the organization and then proliferating to other devices in search for authorized access to business assets. Traditional security systems allow static access to business assets and lack intent validation. Additionally, there are no controls to block access to SaaS applications from compromised endpoints. By implementing comprehensive Zero Trust for all devices we eliminate unauthorized communication in the organization.

* Unified SSO including 2FA/MFA authentication for proprietary and SaaS applications. This prevents bots and threats from accessing business assets
* False positive threat elimination and integration with EDR to ensure compromised devices are declined access business assets
* Zero Trust Isolation for all devices to limit lateral propagation of threats
* SSO authentication for accessing IoTs ensures that vulnerable enterprise IoTs canâ€™t be used as a launchpad for data breaches
