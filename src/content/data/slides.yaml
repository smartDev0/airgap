  intro: >-
    Microsoft has warned organizations globally about a new type of data-stealing Java-based ransomware dubbed
    “PonyFinal”. The tech giant described the malware as human-operated ransomware, which is distributed in an automated
    way by attackers.

    “PonyFinal is a Java-based ransomware that is deployed in human-operated ransomware attacks. While Java-based
    ransomware is not unheard of, they are not as common as other threat file types. However, organizations should focus
    less on this payload and more on how it’s delivered,” Microsoft said in a post.

- title: TFlower Ransomware
  intro: >-
    The strain dubbed TFlower splashed onto the scene in late July 2019. It infects organizations through unprotected or
    poorly secured RDP ports. As soon as the furtive infiltration takes place, the ransomware runs a number of commands
    to disable Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS) and thereby thwart easy data recovery. When traversing the plagued
    computers for valuable data to be encrypted, it ignores critical system files and objects stored in the Sample
    Music folder.
