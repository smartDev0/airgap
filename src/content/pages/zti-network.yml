  text: >-
    Ransomware and malware continue to wreak havoc across all industries. A
    single infected device on a trusted network can propagate ransomware and
    bring down an entire network in seconds. 


    Airgap's Zero Trust Isolation protects against ransomware spread by isolating devices in a ring-fence. By default, they cannot communicate with each other. This eliminates lateral threat propagation. 


    Zero Trust Isolation is agentless, making it the industry's only platform that provides these protections on all devices (managed or unmanaged), regardless of whether they are on corporate or public networks.

      ### Visibility


      Zero Trust Isolation provides visibility for all traffic flows, including authorized and unauthorized communications, between all devices in a shared VLAN.

      ### Ransomware Kill Switch


      Zero Trust Isolation also enables the Ransomware Kill Switch, which instantly shuts down all lateral traffic when ransomware is detected on the network.

      ### Autonomous Policy Framework


      Zero Trust Isolation auto-enforces business policies as devices enter and leave the network with autonomous policy controls.

      Reduce the attack surface on enterprise private applications by eliminating network level access. And add additional security with mandatory SSO and MFA for any user, any device, from any location.
