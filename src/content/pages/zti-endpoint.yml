  title: Zero Trust Isolation™ for Endpoint
copy:
  text: |
    Organizations' cyber-security defenses constantly need to be monitored and improved to prevent malware from moving laterally within a network, encrypting files and/or exfiltrating data.


    At Airgap Networks, our focus is on detection and prevention by blocking and isolating intruder beachheads which are used to launch attack campaigns across networks. Our working assumption is that any device on an organization's network can become compromised, leading to our default security posture, the denial of all lateral traffic movement. Of course, there will be exceptions, and our simple-to-use policy management allows SecOps teams to be very prescriptive on which lateral traffic is permitted.


    With Zero Trust Isolation, Airgap Networks is addressing two exploitable legacy networking vulnerabilities;

    - Devices on a shared VLAN having a complete view and communication path to all other devices
    - Inadequate or stale static policies that fail to restrict network level access to business applications


    These vulnerabilities have led to IT teams unwittingly building data superhighways, which after careful examination by our cybersecurity experts, are most frequently used (or more accurately abused) by threat actors to propagate malware.


    Zero Trust Isolation is a seamless deployment, no forklift upgrades, no agents needed on endpoints. Complements and augments existing security postures. Zero Trust Isolation inverts the traditional shared VLAN trust model concept, uniquely isolating devices and denying all lateral traffic by default. While simultaneously restricting network level access, by enforcing Single Sign-on / Multi-Factor Authentication challenges, to verify the access request intent.
