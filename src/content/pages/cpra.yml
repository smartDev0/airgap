      ### Ransomware Kill Switch™

      Ransomware Kill Switch sharply reduces the “blast radius” of an attack, usually to a single endpoint! Once your incident response team remediates the attack, the network is normalized by again flipping the “1-click” switch.

  text: Ransomware shouldn't be the scourge that it is. This is a solvable problem, or at the very least one
    that we know how to manage and limits its spread. No organization has an excuse anymore with today's security
    solutions to get ripped by these attacks.
