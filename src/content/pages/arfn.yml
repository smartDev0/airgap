    #### The Airgap Anti-Ransomware for Non-Profit Organization


    There has never been a brighter spotlight on the societal scourge of ransomware over the past couple months, from gasoline shortage to disrupted healthcare IT, we see an international uproar for governments and industry to do more and hold cybercriminals accountable.


    #### Ransomware Attacks Are Not a Matter of If, but When.


    Don't assume you are not the target. Ransomware and malware target every business, person and entity with an internet presence. Non-Profits are no exception. 


    As Ransomware varients are getting more sophisticated and distributed, it will happen rapidly at very large scale and consumer data is at a huge risk.
