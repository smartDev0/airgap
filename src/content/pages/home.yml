  title: Trust is often breached
  text: >-
    Traditional security controls allow excessive trust between corporate
    assets. Devices on shared networks (VLANs) can freely communicate and static
    firewall / VPN policies grant network access to the application stack.


    This means, once the threat has landed inside your network, it is free to expand across devices and applications. We all know what happens next!

  tableContent:
    - column1: Lateral propagation starts over shared VLANs impacting large number of
        devices
      column2: Lateral propagation over shared VLAN remains unprotected
      column3: Eliminates unauthorized communication and thwarts lateral propagation
    - column1: "Penetrate business applications via endpoints and encrypt information\t"
      column2: Network level access to business application stack exposes key
        vulnerabilities
      column3: Prevents data breaches via SSO/MFA authorization and intent check for
        each application session
    - column1: Exploit insecure remote work environments for data theft
      column2: VPNs grant network level access to business application stack
      column3: Limits VPN connections to application sessions only
    - column1: Exploit legacy and insecure protocols for maximum impact
      column2: Lack of dedicated monitoring and protection for legacy protocols
      column3: Continuous profiling and AI/ML based anomaly detection for instant
